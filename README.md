# CodeFellows_CyberSec_Coding

This repository contains code and scripts for Bash, Powershell, and Python. There are also Virtualization documents for Amazon AWS, EC2, SSH, and more.
I am working on these skills personally grow in field of Cyber Security and Automation.
I have learned much about funcitons, variables, arguments, and more in regards to code and how automation can performed using the languages mentioned above.
Python is a language I've greatly been interested so I really enjoyed that. Learning that Bash and Powershell isn't too different from Python in terms of coding is a huge plus
This allows me to expand my skillset to additional languages. I also really enjoyed working on virtualization as I believe the cloud is the future of computing.
Shell scripting can be applied to the workplace because it allows users to perform work remotely and efficiently. Once we have SSH access it's no different
than if we were right in front of the machine we are acccessing. It makes user and network management much more efficient as well.
I would work on scripts in bash, powershell, and python to be honest. I really enjoyed them all regardless of the challenge it brought. I plan
on learning more about these languages for automation.
I would like to seamlessly create multiple SSH instances and be able to create VPNs as well to connect across all OS platforms. Improving language understanding
will also improve the rate at which I can create scripts, so I'll be working on this.
